# That's what she said

This is a python program processing user input in the for of speech and providing the result. This uses the SpeechRecognition package and Google's Speech Recognition. 
This is based on one of my favorite shows, The Office. It accepts inputs from the user and checks if it's worthy of Steve Carell's legendary lines. 

I've collected a few phrases from the internet and added them to a text file. New phrases can be added by appending them to the end of the text file. 
The program checks if the user's words are present in the text file and if yes, them the audio file is played.

Now what if the phrase is not present in the text file? Well why don't you try it yourself and find out (also what she said).
